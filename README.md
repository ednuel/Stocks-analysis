# Stocks-analysis

## Challenge-bold

### The biggest challenge I had was I found myself forgetting too save as macro enabled sheets so my button wasn't working at first, until I saved as .xlsm


## Porject Background
### The purpose of our Stock Analysis challenge was to help Steve easily compare *Total Daily Volume* and *Yearly Return* for the years *2017* and *2018*. By creating a VBA for 2017 and 2018, Steve can easily compare stocks and industries. One advantage of using Macros is it reduces the chance for more human error and relies on your Macro instead to be more efficient.
